# Movie Simulation with OpenAI Agents SDK - Implementation Plan

## 🎯 **Project Overview**

A dynamic movie simulation system where users provide a story seed, and an AI Director creates characters and storylines that autonomously interact while staying true to their personalities and the overall narrative arc.

### **Core Vision**
- **User Input**: "A murder mystery in a small tech company during a product launch"
- **Director**: Creates timeline, characters, and initial setup
- **Characters**: Autonomous agents that interact, create plot twists, but stay in character
- **Observer**: Monitors quality and suggests interventions
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Director intervenes when story goes off-track

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture with OpenAI Agents SDK**

### **SDK Primitives Used**
- **Agents**: Director, Scene Manager, Character Agents, Observer
- **Handoffs**: Story progression and character interactions
- **Function Tools**: Memory, dramatic events, character actions
- **Guardrails**: Character consistency, story coherence
- **Tracing**: Built-in monitoring and debugging

### **Agent Flow Design**
```
User Story Seed
    ↓
Director Agent (Creates setup & characters)
    ↓ [handoff]
Scene Manager Agent (Manages interactions)
    ↓ [handoffs to characters]
Character Agents (Autonomous interactions)
    ↓ [handoff back]
Observer Agent (Quality monitoring)
    ↓ [intervention triggers]

## 🎭 **Agent Architecture**

### **1. Director Agent (Story God)**

```python
from agents import Agent, handoff, function_tool
from typing import List, Dict

director_agent = Agent(
    name="Movie Director",
    model="gpt-4o",
    instructions="""
    You are the omniscient director of this story simulation. Your role:
    
    INITIAL SETUP:
    - Analyze user's story seed and determine genre, setting, themes
    - Create compelling character profiles with motivations and secrets
    - Establish initial timeline and story beats
    - Set up opening scene with clear objectives
    
    MONITORING POWERS:
    - Watch all character interactions for story progression
    - Detect when story is stalling, going off-track, or lacks tension
    - Identify character consistency violations
    - Monitor pacing and dramatic tension
    
    INTERVENTION TRIGGERS:
    - Story deviating >70% from main plot
    - Characters breaking personality consistently
    - Dramatic tension below 0.3 for >5 interactions
    - Story stalling without progress
    - Plot holes or contradictions emerging
    
    INTERVENTION METHODS:
    - Inject dramatic events or complications
    - Create new characters mid-story if needed
    - Force scene transitions or setting changes
    - Provide character motivation adjustments
    - Redirect conversations toward plot objectives
    
    HANDOFF DECISIONS:
    - Use Scene Manager for character interactions
    - Handoff to Observer for quality assessment
    - Only intervene directly when absolutely necessary
    """,
    tools=[
        create_character_profiles,
        establish_story_timeline,
        inject_dramatic_event,
        create_new_character,
        adjust_story_tension,
        check_plot_progress,
        force_scene_transition
    ],
    handoffs=[
        handoff(scene_manager_agent, tool_name_override="start_scene"),
        handoff(observer_agent, tool_name_override="assess_story_quality")
    ],
    guardrails=[story_coherence_guardrail],
    output_type=StoryDirective
)
```

### **2. Scene Manager Agent (Interaction Coordinator)**

```python
scene_manager_agent = Agent(
    name="Scene Manager",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",  # Faster for coordination
    instructions="""
    You coordinate character interactions within scenes. Your responsibilities:
    
    SCENE SETUP:
    - Establish scene context (location, time, mood, present characters)
    - Determine scene objectives and dramatic potential
    - Set interaction parameters and turn-taking rules
    
    INTERACTION MANAGEMENT:
    - Decide which character should speak/act next
    - Maintain natural conversation flow
    - Ensure all present characters get appropriate involvement
    - Monitor for scene completion or need for transition
    
    HANDOFF LOGIC:
    - Hand off to characters based on:
      * Who has most to gain/lose in current situation
      * Whose secrets/motivations are most relevant
      * Natural conversation flow and reactions
      * Character relationships and dynamics
    
    - Hand back to Director when:
      * Scene objectives completed
      * Story intervention needed
      * New scene transition required
      * Character conflict resolution needed
    
    Keep scenes dynamic and purposeful. Avoid endless conversations.

    handoffs=[],  # Will be populated with character agents dynamically
    output_type=SceneUpdate

```

### **3. Character Agent Factory**

```python
def create_character_agent(character_profile: CharacterProfile) -> Agent:
    """Create a specialized character agent with personality and memory"""
    
    return Agent(
        name=character_profile.name,
        model="gpt-4o",
        instructions=f"""
        You are {character_profile.name} in this story simulation.
        
        CORE IDENTITY:
        - Name: {character_profile.name}
        - Background: {character_profile.background}
        - Personality: {character_profile.personality_traits}
        - Role in Story: {character_profile.story_role}
        
        SECRETS & MOTIVATIONS:
        - Hidden Secrets: {character_profile.secrets}
        - Primary Motivation: {character_profile.primary_motivation}
        - Secondary Goals: {character_profile.secondary_goals}
        - Fears/Vulnerabilities: {character_profile.fears}
        
        RELATIONSHIPS:
        {format_relationships(character_profile.relationships)}
        
        BEHAVIORAL RULES:
        - Stay absolutely true to your personality at all times
        - Protect your secrets but act naturally and believably
        - React authentically based on your background and motivations
        - You can create plot twists that align with your character
        - Build on other characters' actions and revelations
        - Show appropriate emotions based on your personality
        
        KNOWLEDGE BOUNDARIES:
        - You know everything that happened in your presence
        - You know what others have explicitly told you
        - You remember past interactions and their emotional impact
        - You DO NOT know other characters' private thoughts or secrets
        - You can suspect, guess, or theorize, but cannot know for certain
        
        INTERACTION STYLE:
        - Respond naturally to dialogue and situations
        - Ask questions that your character would realistically ask
        - Take actions that serve your motivations while staying in character
        - Show growth and change through experiences, but maintain core personality

### **4. Observer Agent (Quality Monitor)**

```python
observer_agent = Agent(
    name="Story Observer",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    instructions="""
    You monitor story quality and provide insights for improvement.

## 🎮 **Usage Examples**

### **Basic Usage**
```python
from movie_simulator_agents_sdk import MovieSimulation

# Initialize simulation
simulation = MovieSimulation()

# Run simulation with user input
story_seed = """
A murder mystery at a tech startup during their big product launch. 
The victim is the CEO, found dead in the server room. 
The suspects include the CTO who was passed over for promotion, 
the marketing director with gambling debts, and the intern who 
discovered financial irregularities.
"""

final_story = await simulation.run_simulation(story_seed)
print(final_story)
```

### **Advanced Configuration**
```python
# Custom configuration
config = SimulationConfig(
    max_interactions=150,
    intervention_threshold=0.3,
    genre_constraints=["mystery", "corporate_drama"],
    target_length="short_story",  # 20-30 interactions
    dramatic_arc="classic_three_act"
)

simulation = MovieSimulation(config)

# With custom memory system
memory_system = CustomMemorySystem(
    storage_backend="sqlite",  # Your future DB
    embedding_model="text-embedding-3-small",
    similarity_threshold=0.7
)

context = MovieContext(
    story_state=StoryState(),
    characters={},
    current_scene=SceneContext(),
    memory_system=memory_system,
    current_time=datetime.now()
)

final_story = await simulation.run_simulation_with_context(
    story_seed, context
)
```

# Automatic tracing of all agent interactions
# View in OpenAI Dashboard:
# - Agent handoffs and decision points
# - Tool usage and parameters
# - Conversation history
# - Performance metrics
# - Error tracking

# Custom tracing for story events
from agents import trace_span

@trace_span("character_interaction")
async def character_dialogue(char1: str, char2: str, topic: str):
    # Custom tracing for story-specific events
    pass
```

### **2. Powerful Handoff System**
```python
# Natural story progression through handoffs
director_agent = Agent(
    handoffs=[
        handoff(scene_manager, tool_name_override="start_new_scene"),
        handoff(observer, tool_name_override="analyze_story"),
        # Dynamic character handoffs added at runtime
    ]
)

# Handoff with context filtering
handoff(
    character_agent,
    input_filter=remove_secret_information,  # Custom filter
    on_handoff=lambda ctx: log_character_interaction(ctx)
)
```

### **3. Flexible Tool Integration**
```python
# Any Python function becomes a tool
@function_tool
async def search_character_psychology(
    character_id: str, 
    emotional_state: str
) -> PersonalityInsights:
    """Analyze character's psychological state"""
    # Complex character analysis logic
    return insights

# Hosted tools for enhanced capabilities
agent = Agent(
    tools=[
        WebSearchTool(),  # For researching story elements
        CodeInterpreterTool(),  # For story analytics
        search_character_psychology  # Custom function
    ]
)
```

### **4. Robust Guardrails**
```python
# Multi-layered safety and quality control
character_agent = Agent(
    input_guardrails=[
        content_safety_check,
        character_knowledge_validator
    ],
    output_guardrails=[
        personality_consistency_check,
        dialogue_quality_validator,

## 🎬 **Conclusion**

This implementation plan leverages the OpenAI Agents SDK's core strengths:

✅ **Native multi-agent coordination** through handoffs
✅ **Built-in tracing and debugging** for complex interactions  
✅ **Flexible tool integration** for story mechanics
✅ **Robust guardrails** for quality control
✅ **Production-ready architecture** with error handling

The system creates a living, breathing movie where:
- **Characters drive the story** through authentic interactions
- **Director maintains narrative coherence** without stifling creativity
- **Quality monitoring ensures** engaging, believable content
- **Dynamic adaptation** handles unexpected story directions

**Next Steps**: Start with Phase 1 foundation and build incrementally, testing each component thoroughly before moving to the next phase.

The SDK's handoff system is particularly well-suited for story progression, where narrative control naturally flows between director, scene manager, and characters, creating organic story development while maintaining overall coherence.
